== Description ==

= What Is The Epic Bouwer WordPress Page Builder? =

If you haven't already, watch the video below or [try out the demo](http://demo.wpbeaverbuilder.com/?utm_source=external&utm_medium=wp-repo&utm_campaign=builder-description) to see it in action!

Head on over to [our website](http://www.epicwebsite.nl/epicbouwer/?utm_source=external&utm_medium=wp-repo&utm_campaign=builder-description) to learn more about the Epic Bouwer WordPress page builder and what it can do for you. 

= Who Is Epic Bouwer For? =

Anyone that can learn WordPress can learn to use Epic Bouwer. Developers that need a little more can build custom widgets using the WordPress plugin system to get the job done. Users of the [pro or agency versions](http://www.epicwebsite.nl/epicbouwer/pricing/?utm_source=external&utm_medium=wp-repo&utm_campaign=builder-description) also get access to premium documentation and support for extending the builder through the development of custom modules.

= A WordPress Page Builder That Works With Your Theme =

Yep, that's right! Epic Bouwer was designed to work with almost any WordPress theme. We say "almost" because it's impossible for us to test every theme that exists. Don't hesitate to let us know if you run into a compatibility issue with your theme so we can look into it and release a fix if possible.

= Modules And Widgets =

We've loaded Epic Bouwer up with a comprehensive set of content modules to aid you in building stunning layouts and landing pages within an intuitive drag and drop system. In addition to content modules, Epic Bouwer also supports core and third party WordPress widgets and shortcodes, making the number of things you can drop into a layout or landing page almost endless.

= A WordPress Page Builder That's Optimized For Mobile =

Every part of a Epic Bouwer layout or landing page is fully responsive and looks gorgeous on any screen size. Easily drop any number of columns onto the page that will adjust automagically as the screen gets smaller. Don't worry, if responsive sites aren't your thing, that functionality can be turned off at anytime in the global page builder settings.

= A WordPress Page Builder That's Optimized For Performance =

We've designed Epic Bouwer to create layouts and landing pages that load quickly. Many page builders load in an ungodly number of scripts and stylesheets to every page on your site. Not Epic Bouwer! It only loads the assets needed for a given layout or landing page, instead of slowing your site down by loading everything.

= WordPress.org Support =
